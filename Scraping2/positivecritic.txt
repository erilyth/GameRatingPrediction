The fighting engine is awesome. The graphics are awesome. The characters' moves are awesome. This game just plain kicks ass.
Wickedly sick action, amazingly fast gameplay, mother of all.... What more is there to say? Tekken 2 rules! The undeniable king of fighting games is here, and it's time to break bones and necks.
This game take the PlayStation to a new level of excellence. The graphics are the most fluid and detailed yet seen. The gameplay is even hotter than the original.
Another twist unique (I think) to Tekken 2 is the infinite fighting area. If you hate the cheap 'Ring Outs' in "VF2" or "Battle Arena Toshinden" or if your irritating friend keeps pinning you against the wall when playing X-Men, you'll love the unlimited fighting area.
The backgrounds are definitely more involved this time around, replacing the barren Virtua Fighter I-style backdrops with detailed, and occasionally moving, fighting arenas. And the light sourcing! It has to be seen to be believed.
Blocky 3D brawler borrowed from "Virtua Fighter" to bring grade-A whoop ass to Sony's console. [Jan 2004, p.189]
Good in the sense that it means anyone can instantly pick it up and perform miraculous feats of head-cleaving prowess. But bad because it means you can effortlessly plough straight through it without having to work very hard.
Characters are more varied and numerous, the moves possible with each of these characters is multiplied many fold, and the environments which they interact are certainly more detailed.
